# BlackJack Card Game

## Deployed Project

* [`BlackJack`](https://tutchings.github.io/blackjack/)

## Description

* This is a classic BlackJack card game that I built as a personal project.

* Face cards have a value of 10, number cards have a face value, and aces can be either 1 or 11.

* The object of the game is for the value of your cards to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
